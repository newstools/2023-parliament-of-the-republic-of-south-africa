Parliament, Friday, 24 February 2023 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has congratulated Proteas Women following their victory against England in the T20 World Cup currently on the go in the country.
	
	The South African women will play Australia in what promises to be a scintillating final in Cape Town.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane, said the committee was impressed by the progress South African women were making in all major sporting codes. Banyana Banyana are currently African Champions; Women Boks fared very well at the rugby World Cup last year in New Zealand, now Proteas are in the final.
	
	“In sports things are changing for the better; all we need is investments into the sports. This is inspiring and an example young girls should seek to emulate,” said Ms Dlulane.
	
	She said she speaks for everyone in the country in saying the country is proud of what this group of young women have achieved. Although South Africa as host, opened the tournament by a loss to Sri Lanka, they marvellously got the campaign back on track and have now placed themselves in a medal position.
	
	Ms Dlulane said it will be up to them to choose the colour. “The country is fully behind our women. The committee is proud of this achievement and wishes the Proteas well on Sunday against Australia,” added Ms Dlualane.
