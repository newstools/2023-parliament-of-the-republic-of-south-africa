Parliament, Monday, 6 February 2023 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture wishes to congratulate Ms Nomcebo Zikode, Mr Zakes Bantwini and Mr Wouter Kellerman on their hit song Bayette’s win in the Best Global Music category at last night’s 2023 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.
	
	The Chairperson Ms Beauty Dlulane said the committee celebrated these achievements on behalf of all South Africans. “This is good marketing for South Africa. These illustrious performers have done really well, and we ought to see how best to reward them as a country. Who in the world does not know the Jerusalema dance, for which Nomcebo has garnered international fame, not only for herself but South Africa?”
	
	Ms Dlulane said the committee congratulates these three artists and wishes them well in the future. Last year, South Africa’s Black Coffee achieved a similar feat.
	
	“What these artists have achieved is proof that the international community is aware of our country and the opportunities that South Africa has. It becomes our responsibility to then decide how we could host the world. These are our ambassadors, who have made it their responsibility to market South Africa.”
	
	This award is indicative of that, she said.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SPORT, ARTS AND CULTURE, MS BEAUTY DLULANE.
