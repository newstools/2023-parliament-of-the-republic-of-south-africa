Parliament, Wednesday, 1 February 2023 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, has welcomed a significant improvement in the health and safety of mineworkers since the introduction of the Mine Health and Safety Act 25 years ago.
	
	On Tuesday, the Mine Health and Safety Council’s Chief Inspector of Mines released the annual mine health and safety statistics for the 2021/22 financial year, which showed a significant reduction in the number of fatalities, injuries and occupational diseases.
	
	According to the Chief Inspector of Mines, the sector has recorded a 4% reduction in injuries in the year under review as well as 74 and 49 fatalities in 2021 and 2022 respectively.
	
	The reduction in the number of fatalities represents a 34% year-on-year improvement. The sector further recorded a 100% reduction in machinery-related fatalities.
	
	Mr Luzipo is pleased that for seven consecutive months in 2022, there were no fatal accidents as a result of the fall of ground (FOG) in the gold sector. “We are particularly pleased that no mine disaster has been recorded in four years, since 2018. This good work can only be attributable to the spirit of tripartism and cooperation amongst all stakeholders involved,” said Mr Luzipo.
	
	Furthermore, Mr Luzipo has welcomed a 4.42% reduction in the number of occupational diseases. Silicosis cases decreased by 11.4% in the year under review, noise over-exposure reduced from 0.87% in 2020 to 0.51% in 2021 and over-exposure to airborne pollutants reduced from 6.87% in 2020 to 5.54% in 2021.
	
	Mr Luzipo said that although the goal is to achieve zero harm in the sector, the work done by all stakeholders indicates a movement in the right direction, which is highly commendable.
	
	He said: “Our general principle remains that one life lost is one too many. It is for this reason that we would like to recognise the fact that these much-improved results come at a time when we observe the seventh commemoration of the Lilly Mine disaster.”
