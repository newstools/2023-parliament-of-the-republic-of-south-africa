Parliament, Tuesday, 28 February 2023 - The Presiding Officers of Parliament are saddened to confirm that a Member of Parliament in the National Council of Provinces passed away suddenly this afternoon during Membersâ€™ training workshop organised by the Council at the Cape Town City Lodge.
	
	Hon Maurencia Natalie Gillion, who was attending the three-day strategic review and planning workshop that started today, suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness during the afternoon session. She sadly passed away on the spot following unsuccessful attempts to resuscitate her.

	"All of us are in a state of great grief, inexplicable shock and anguish. Nothing could have prepared any of us here for this. To lose a Member of Parliament is very sad, but to lose her in this manner is just harrowing. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the family of Hon Gillion and pray for their strength to surmount this unbearable pain," said the Presiding Officers.
	
	Hon Gilion, who represented the Western Cape Province in the NCOP, served in the select committee on health and social services. She was a member of the African National Congress.
