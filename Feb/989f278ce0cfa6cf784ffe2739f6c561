Parliament, Thursday, 23 February 2023 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, Mr Khaya Magaxa, has noted and welcomed the announcement from the Eskom Board yesterday that Eskom’s former Chief Executive Officer, Mr Andre de Ruyter, has left the power utility with immediate effect.
	
	Mr Magaxa said the committee has learnt that during a special board meeting yesterday, the Eskom board and Mr de Ruyter reached a mutual agreement to “curtail his notice period to 28 February 2023”. The board further resolved that Mr de Ruyter will not be required to serve the balance of his notice period, but will be released from his position with immediate effect.
	
	Mr Magaxa said the committee has noted a serious allegation made by Mr de Ruyter in a recent interview with a local media house before he left Eskom. “As the committee with a constitutional responsibility of oversight over Eskom, we can’t ignore those serious allegations. We need to follow them until truth is exposed and the perpetrator is held to account for wrongdoing,” said Mr Magaxa.
