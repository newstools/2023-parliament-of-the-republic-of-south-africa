The new Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Forestry, Fisheries and Environment, Mr Pogiso Modise, has pledged impartiality and objectivity in carrying out the work of the committee. The committee elected Mr Modise on Tuesday as the new Chairperson following the departure of Ms Faith Muthambi last year. Mr Modise said the committee’s open-door policy and team work will remain. “We remain a solid team committed to impartiality, objectivity. We remain a solid multiparty team led by all of you (Members of Parliament). Mr Modise said the committee will work for the common good, guided by parliamentary principles in order to strengthen the work of Parliament. “We commit to do our very best to listen and ensure transparency to stakeholders and all sectors within our scope of work and beyond.” Mr Modise’s election comes at a time when the committee is engaged in a nationwide public hearings programme on the Climate Change Bill. The bill is fundamental to South Africa’s future, as it is intended to protect South Africans from the harsh impact of climate change through regulating mitigation and adaptation strategies. He will lead the committee in public hearings on the Bill in Limpopo this weekend. Mr Modise praised Ms Muthambi for her resolute commitment to the committee’s work and the guidance she has provided to the committee since 2019. 15 February 2023
