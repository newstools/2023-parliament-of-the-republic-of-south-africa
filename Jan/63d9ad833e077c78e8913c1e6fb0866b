Parliament, Tuesday, 17 January 2023 - Parliament is saddened and shocked by the news of the untimely death of the Ugu District Municipality Mayor, Ms Phumlile Mthiyane.
	
	The Presiding Officers of Parliament, led by National Assembly (NA) Speaker, Ms Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, and National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Chairperson, Mr Amos Masondo said the Mayor’s sudden passing is a great blow to the residents of the Ugu District in KwaZulu Natal, who were beginning to benefit from the service delivery interventions she initiated since her appointment.
	
	Ms Mthiyane was committed to good governance and intergovernmental relations efforts. In November 2022, her District successfully hosted the Taking Parliament to the People public participation programme, where she provided necessary leadership and guidance consistent with the principles of cooperative governance and intergovernmental relations.
	
	They said, in her, South Africa has lost a very dedicated public servant who was yet to do even more for the rest of the country in so far as service delivery interventions are concerned.
	
	Parliament wishes her family, comrades and her political party comfort during this difficult time.
	
	May her soul rest in peace.
