Parliament, Monday, 30 January 2023 – The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) will this week conduct an oversight visit to the Kannaland Local Municipality in the Western Cape.
	
	The committee’s oversight visit to the municipality is a follow-up on the virtual engagements held with the municipality on 23 November 2022 and 1 September 2020. This is one of the 64 municipalities identified as dysfunctional in terms of the Department of Cooperative Governance’s June 2021 State of Local Government Report.
