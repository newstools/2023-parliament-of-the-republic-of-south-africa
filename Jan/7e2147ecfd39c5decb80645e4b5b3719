Parliament, Monday, 16 January 2023 - Parliament is aware that Members of the media who applied to cover the 2023 State of the Nation Address have received automated emails informing them that their applications were declined. The email was erroneously sent by the system.
	
	The closing date for online applications was Friday, 13 January 2023, and the process of auditing and vetting them is currently underway. Only when this process is complete can Parliament give feedback to all applicants on the outcome of their applications.
	
	Parliament urges all applicants to ignore the email and sincerely apologises for the error.
