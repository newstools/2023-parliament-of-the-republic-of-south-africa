Parliament, Wednesday, 18 January 2023 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), Mr Fikile Xasa, has noted with deep sadness the passing of the Ugu District Municipality Mayor, Ms Phumlile Mthiyane, and Ugu Municipal Manager, Dr Elliot Michael Ntombela, who died a few days apart.
	
	Mr Xasa said the loss of these two leaders in Ugu District Municipality occurred during a very difficult time, when the municipality is trying to recover from the severe damage caused by the April 2022 floods disaster, which impoverished the municipality further. The committee sends its heartfelt condolences to the families and colleagues of the deceased in the district and in the province, as well as in the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs.
	
	“They have both been hailed as committed public servants who showed passion for their work and they have left an indelible mark that will ever be cherished. May their loved ones be comforted during this difficult time,” said Mr Xasa
