Parliament, Thursday, 19 January 2023 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Mr Fikile Xasa, has welcomed the arrest of former Mkhondo Local Municipality Mayor Mr Vusi Motha, who has been charged with possession of unlicensed fire arms and ammunition. Mkhondo Local Municipality is situated within the Gert Sibande District in the Mpumalanga Province. According to media reports, Mr Motha and his co-accused have appeared before the Piet Retief Magistrate’s Court.
	
	The committee appreciated the quick action by the South African Police Service in this case and hopes that this arrest will serve as a deterrent to any councilor who wants to participate in illegal activities. It is important that municipal councilors uphold their duties of being public representatives and act in the best interests of the communities they live in. ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON COOPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS, MR FIKILE XASA.
