Parliament, Monday, 16 January 2023 – The Acting Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Transport, Mr Lisa Mangcu, has noted with concern the many road fatalities that have occurred during the festive season.
	
	It is of great concern to the committee that road fatalities involving trucks are on the increase and have become so common that they arouse no outcry. “These fatalities seem to be occurring locally and the indication is that recklessness and driver behaviour are attributable. Enforcement agencies need to look into this and find a way to courteously deal with driver behaviour,” said Mr Mangcu.
	
	“The situation calls for law enforcement to be stringent, with stiff penalties imposed. It is just not right that South Africans continue to perish and are harmed on the roads during holidays,” he added. Mr Mangcu believes that the situation will only improve once all drivers accept that road safety is their responsibility.
	
	Although official statistics have not been released to the public, Gauteng alone experienced more than 80 vehicle accidents, while over 140 people reportedly passed away on the roads in KwaZulu-Natal. The Road Traffic Management Corporation will release the official statistics in due course.
	
	Mr Mangcu said although effective rail transport is a necessity, driver behaviour is the main contributor to road accidents.
