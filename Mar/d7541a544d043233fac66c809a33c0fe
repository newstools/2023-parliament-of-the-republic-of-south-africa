	Parliament, Thursday 02 March 2023 – The National Assembly Programming Committee (NAPC) has during its meeting this morning agreed to reschedule the sitting that will deliberate on the “Motion of No Confidence” against the Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, for 22 March 2023.
	
	Initially, the sitting was scheduled for 7 March. However, due to the unavailability of the City Hall, where the Assembly has been holding its full physical sittings, on that day, a decision was taken to shift the sitting to 22 March.
	
	All Members of the National Assembly are expected to be physically present in the House as the motion will be decided using the open ballot voting system. The same method was employed during the processing of Section 89 Independent Panel report.
	
	On the recommendation of the list of persons for appointment by the President to serve on the SABC Board, the Speaker announced that Parliament has now clarified all issues raised by the President.
	
	On 06 December 2022, the National Assembly adopted the report of the Portfolio Committee on Communications and Digital Technologies which recommended names to the President to fill the 12 non-executive vacancies on the SABC Board.
