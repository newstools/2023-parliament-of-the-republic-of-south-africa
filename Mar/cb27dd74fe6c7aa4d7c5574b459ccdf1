Parliament, Wednesday, 1 March 2023 – The Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities has learnt with sadness of the sudden passing yesterday afternoon of the Chairperson of the Select Committee on Health and Social Services, Ms Maurencia Natalie Gillion.
	
	Committee Chairperson Ms Nonhlanhla Ncube-Ndaba said, “Our committees worked very closely for almost two years during the Covid pandemic on the filling of vacancies for the National Youth Development Agency. Ms Gillion and I co-chaired through many months of long hours and hard work. I will forever remember her calm demeanor, fairness and conciliatory approach through that time. Even when she had suffered family loss or was ill, her unwavering commitment to the work on hand never stopped.”
	
	The committee expresses its heartfelt condolences to the family of the late Ms Gillion and to the Select Committee on Health and Social Services. Parliament and the country has lost a female leader who served with passion and commitment; her contributions will never to be forgotten.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON WOMEN, YOUTH AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, MS NONNHLANHLA NCUBE-NDABA.
