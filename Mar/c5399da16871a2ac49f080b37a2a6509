Parliament, Saturday, 4 March 2023 – The Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy will tomorrow conduct public hearings on the Upstream Petroleum Resources Development (UPRD) Bill [B13-2021] in Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality in Gqeberha.
	
	The Bill seeks to separate petroleum provision from mineral provision, as currently provided for in the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (Act No. 28 of 2002). The separation is aimed at providing two independent pieces of legislation to address matters pertinent to each industry and to bring about stability and security to investors, especially in the upstream petroleum sector.
	
	Furthermore, the Bill enhances state participation in the upstream petroleum industry and economic transformation of the industry. It includes provisions that promote petroleum resources development in a sustainable and equitable manner for the benefit of all South Africans.
	
	Details of the Bill are as follows:
	
	Date: Sunday, 5 March 2023
	Venue: Wells Estate Multipurpose Centre in Motherwell
	Time: 10:00
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES.
