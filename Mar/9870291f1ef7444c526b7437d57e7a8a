The theme is informed by evidence that the world is at its lowest ebb of peacefulness in over 15 years because of a series of conflicts including the War in Ukraine.
	
	The five-day session of the 133-year-old multilateral organisation started yesterday at the Exhibition World Bahrain and will conclude on 15 March 2023. It is attended by representatives of 110 parliaments, including delegations from countries in conflict situations.

	Meanwhile, the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), Mr Amos Masondo, is leading a multi-party parliamentary delegation to the sittings of the Pan African Parliament (PAP) committees and other PAP organs, taking place from 05 to 17 March.
	Issues being discussed and considered include the unpacking of the AU theme for 2023, the Role of the PAP in implementing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the role of the PAP in Promoting Transparency and Accountability and Fighting Corruption within the Continent.
	
	At Parliament, this week’s programme includes questions for oral reply by the Governance Cluster Ministers, consideration of Bills, debates and public hearings from both Houses of Parliament.

The cluster comprises ministers responsible for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs; Ministry in the Presidency; Public Service and Administration; and the Ministry responsible for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities.
	
	Parliament uses a range of instruments to scrutinise executive action, including question-and-answer sessions. Section 92 (2) of the Constitution also stipulates that Cabinet Members are accountable collectively and individually to Parliament for the exercise of their powers and performance of their functions.
	
	The same sitting will also consider a draft Resolution by the Chief Whip of the Opposition on the establishment of an ad hoc committee to conduct an inquiry into matters surrounding the Phala Phala game farm theft with specific reference to the involvement and response of the various government departments and agencies in the alleged cover-up of the crime.
